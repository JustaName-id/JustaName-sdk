# Why We Exist

ENS (Ethereum Name Service) was a significant improvement for interacting with blockchain addresses. Previously, wallet addresses were composed of long, complex strings of numbers and letters, creating a significant barrier to user adoption in the Web3 world. ENS introduced the ability to use human-readable names (like yourname.eth) making blockchain interactions much more intuitive and accessible. This transformation was crucial in shaping our understanding of digital identities within the Web3 world.

## Challenges on the Road to Universal Adoption

While ENS represented a significant advancement in the usability of blockchain addresses, certain challenges remain in achieving truly widespread adoption. These include:

- **The Cost Barrier**: ENS names are tied to on-chain transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. These transactions incur costs (often referred to as "gas fees"), which can fluctuate significantly. During periods of high network activity, these fees can become quite expensive, making it difficult for newcomers or those with limited resources to acquire and manage an ENS name.
- **Technical Hurdles**: Though using ENS offers a more user-friendly experience compared to wallet addresses, it still requires a degree of Web3 familiarity. Users need to understand concepts like wallets, transactions, and potentially even interact with decentralized exchanges to purchase the necessary cryptocurrency.
- **Lack of Awareness**: Despite its advantages, ENS might  not be widely known by mainstream users or those new to the blockchain space. Raising awareness and educating potential users about the benefits of human-readable blockchain names would be crucial for broader adoption.

## JustaName: Bridging the Gap

JustaName was created to address these challenges by providing an off-chain solution that extends the functionality of ENS. We "productise" ENS by offering a similar feature set with a focus on abstraction from the underlying gas costs.
Here's how JustaName makes interacting with the blockchain more accessible:

- **Gasless Experience**: By handling transactions off-chain, JustaName abstracts away the gas fees associated with ENS interactions.
- **Simplified User Experience**: JustaName offers a user-friendly interface that removes the complexity of managing gas prices and limits. This allows users to focus on claiming and using their ENS names without worrying about the technical details.
- **Increased Accessibility**: JustaName empowers a broader developer community to participate in the ENS ecosystem by providing user-friendly APIs and an SDK. These tools bypass the complexities of managing gas fees and blockchain interaction, making ENS integration significantly easier. This enhanced accessibility can fuel the growth and adoption of the decentralized web.

In essence, JustaName aims to bridge the gap between the potential of ENS and the user experience by providing a smoother, more cost-effective way to interact with the blockchain naming system.
