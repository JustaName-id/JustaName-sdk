# Exchanges
## The Problem: Address Complexity Hinders Deposits and Withdrawals
Cryptocurrency exchanges, while streamlining the trading process, still often rely on complex blockchain addresses for deposits and withdrawals. This presents several hurdles for users:

* **Mistyping Errors**: Long hexadecimal addresses are prone to typos, potentially leading to lost funds or delays.
* **Confusion for Newcomers**: Understanding and correctly managing raw addresses is a significant barrier to entry, especially for those new to the Web3 environment.
* **Multi-Chain Frustration**: Managing addresses across different blockchains further complicates the user experience.
## How JustaName Solves It
JustaName offers exchanges a solution to streamline deposits and withdrawals, delivering a Web2-like experience:

* **Human-Readable Subnames**: Users can associate exchange accounts with subnames under the exchange's ENS domain (e.g., alice.myexchange.eth).
* **Error Reduction**: Subnames replace complex addresses, minimizing errors during deposits and withdrawals.
* **Ease of Onboarding**: New users can claim their subname immediately, lowering the barrier to entry.
* **Cross-Chain Potential**: JustaName can support subnames on multiple blockchains, simplifying deposits/withdrawals across various networks.

## Example Use Case:

A user deposits funds into their exchange account by sending cryptocurrency to their easy-to-remember (alice.myexchange.eth) subname instead of a complex address. Upon withdrawal, they use the same subname, ensuring seamless transactions.
