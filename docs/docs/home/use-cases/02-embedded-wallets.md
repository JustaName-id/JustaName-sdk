# Embedded Wallets: Streamlining Web3 Onboarding

## The Problem: Streamlining Embedded Wallets for a Web2-Like Experience

While traditional standalone wallets like MetaMask are essential to the Web3 ecosystem, they present onboarding friction for new users. The need to download separate extensions and manage complex seed phrases acts as a barrier to entry, hindering widespread adoption of dApps.

* **Unfamiliar UX**: Standalone wallets often have interfaces geared toward advanced users, intimidating newcomers.
* **Security Concerns**: Users may be hesitant to entrust their assets to a new application.
* **Limited Mainstream Appeal**: The complexity of standalone wallets discourages broader adoption, limiting dApps to tech-savvy audiences.

## How Embedded Wallets Solve It

Embedded wallets integrate directly into dApps and websites, streamlining user onboarding and interactions:

* **Simplified Entry Point**: Users can create wallet accounts directly within the dApps they want to use, without the need for external downloads or installations.
* **Increased Accessibility**: Embedded wallets lower the barrier to entry, attracting users who might be intimidated by standalone wallets.
* **Familiar Web2-like Flow**: Often using a simple email-and-password setup, embedded wallets provide a more comfortable and recognizable user experience.
* **The Remaining Gap**: Web2-Level Identity

While embedded wallets improve access, they still rely on traditional blockchain addresses - long, complex strings of numbers and letters.  This hinders true mainstream appeal because it sacrifices the ease-of-use found in the Web2 world.

## How JustaName Closes the Loop

JustaName acts as the missing piece, providing a Web2-like identity layer on top of embedded wallets:

* **Human-Readable Subnames**: Users can replace their complex wallet address with an easily memorable subname (e.g., sarah.mywallet.eth).
* **Seamless User Experience**: JustaName integration creates a familiar Web2-esque experience while retaining the decentralized benefits of Web3.
* **Cross-dApp Identity**: Subnames become universal usernames across different dApps, enabling users to build a consistent online presence in the Web3 world.

## Example Use Case

A new user visits a DeFi dApp with an embedded wallet. Instead of being presented with a complex address, they create an account with their email and immediately claim a subname (e.g., david.defiapp.eth). This becomes their recognizable identifier across other integrated dApps, and they seamlessly interact with dApps just like they would with familiar web platforms.
