# Social Hub

## The Problem: Fragmented Web3 Identities
Web3 users often struggle with a disjointed online presence. Usernames, avatars, and reputations are scattered across different dApps, forums, and social platforms. This fragmentation leads to:

- **Inconsistent Branding**: Maintaining a unified identity and consistent brand across platforms is a constant struggle.
- **Management Headaches**: Updating profiles across numerous services is time-consuming and tedious.
- **Limited Interoperability**: There's no easy way to transfer reputation or social connections between platforms.

## How JustaName Solves It
JustaName acts as your centralized Web3 social hub, enabling you to manage and express a unified identity across the decentralized web:

- **Universal Web3 Username**: Claim a single subname (e.g., yourname.social.id) that acts as your username across integrated dApps and platforms.
- **Manage Multiple Identities**: Easily create and switch between different sub-profiles under your wallet, allowing you to represent different facets of your online persona as needed.
- **Centralized Profile Management**: Update your profile, avatar, and preferences in one place â€“ changes automatically reflect across linked platforms.
- **Seamless Social Interactions**: Engage in different Web3 communities and carry your reputation and social connections effortlessly.

## Example Use Case:
Sarah is an active Web3 enthusiast, engaging in DeFi protocols, collecting NFTs, and participating in various DAOs. With JustaName, she claims a central profile (sarah.web3.id) and easily creates sub-profiles for different activities (sarah.defi.id, sarah.nftcollector.id). Her reputation established in one area seamlessly carries over to others.  Sarah updates her profile picture once, and it changes across all integrated platforms.  JustaName lets her maintain a consistent Web3 identity while effortlessly managing her participation in diverse communities and projects.
