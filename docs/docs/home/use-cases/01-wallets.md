# Wallets

## The Problem: Complex Addresses and Disconnected User Experiences

Traditional  Web3 wallets often present several usability hurdles:

- **Unwieldy Addresses**: Long, hexadecimal Ethereum addresses are difficult to remember, type, and prone to errors, hindering seamless transactions.
- **Disconnected Identities**: Wallet addresses don't offer a way for users to express their Web3 identity, leading to a fragmented and impersonal experience.
- **Onboarding Barrier**: Understanding and managing blockchain addresses creates a significant hurdle for new users, slowing adoption.

## How JustaName Solves It

JustaName addresses these core issues by providing a user-centric layer on top of ENS:

- **Simplified Identity**: JustaName enables users to associate their wallets with easily recognizable subnames under your walletâ€™s ENS domain (e.g., user.yourwallet.eth). This replaces impersonal addresses with human-readable identifiers.
- **Seamless Onboarding**: New users can immediately claim a subname upon wallet creation, significantly improving adoption by removing the friction of raw addresses.
- **Connected Profiles**: Users can attach metadata, avatars, and other information to their subnames, creating richer Web3 profiles directly within their wallets.
- **Enhanced Community**: Allow the strategic issuance of subnames to build communities within your wallet (e.g., user.yourwallet.eth), fostering loyalty and engagement.

## Example Use Case:
A new user downloads your wallet app.  Instead of being confronted with a complex address, they immediately claim their subname (e.g., sarah.yourwallet.eth) and start seamlessly sending and receiving crypto. Sarah adds a profile picture, making it easier for friends to recognize her within the wallet's interface.
