# Views

The Admin Dashboard provides a clear and detailed view of all subnames issued under your ENS domain, offering key information such as addresses, claim dates, resolution counts, social handles, and verifications.

## Viewing Subname Data on the Dashboard

When an admin navigates to the **Admin Dashboard**, they will have access to a comprehensive view of all subnames issued under the ENS domains they've configured. This default view provides key insights about each subname and its associated metadata.

**Key Data Points in the Default View:**

* **Subname**: The ENS subname that has been claimed (e.g., `user.justan.id`).
* **Address**: The blockchain address linked to the subname.
* **Claim Date**: The date when the subname was claimed.
* **Resolution Count**: The number of times the subname has been resolved (i.e., looked up or used on any platform).
* **Social Handles**: The social media accounts (Twitter, GitHub, etc.) that the user has linked to their subname.
* **Verifications**: The completed verifications attached to the subname, that the user has performed through **JustVerified** or other verification mechanisms.

This default view is designed to give admins a quick and comprehensive overview of the key data points for each subname under their ENS domain, providing valuable information at a glance.

## Customizing the View

Admins have full control over how they view and organize this data. They can customize the dashboard view by choosing which data points are displayed for each subname. This means you can toggle on or off different columns based on what information is most relevant to your needs.

For example, you can choose to:

* Display only the **Subname**, **Address**, and **Claim Date** to focus on basic user data.
* Include **Social Handles** and **Verifications** to monitor user engagement and trust levels within your platform.
* Add **Resolution Count** to track how often certain subnames are being searched or used across platforms.

This flexibility ensures that the dashboard can be tailored to suit different admin goals, whether thatâ€™s monitoring user activity, analyzing social verifications, or tracking subname popularity.

## Reserving Subnames for Specific Addresses

In addition to viewing the issued subnames, admins can also **reserve specific subnames** for predetermined addresses. This is especially useful if certain high-value or branded subnames need to be protected or pre-allocated to specific users or partners. This feature ensures that these reserved subnames are blocked from general registration and are only assignable to the designated addresses.
