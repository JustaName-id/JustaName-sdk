# Filters

The Admin Dashboard offers powerful filtering options to help you manage and analyze your user data more effectively. These filters allow you to refine your view of the subnames associated with your ENS domain, making it easier to find specific subnames or groups of users based on various criteria. By using these filters, admins can extract meaningful insights, target specific user groups, and monitor engagement trends within their platform.

## Available Filters

Admins have access to several filters that can be applied to the subname data, enabling them to narrow down results based on social handles, verifications, claim dates, and resolution activity. Below are the primary filters available on the dashboard:

### 1. Filtering by Attached Social Accounts

This filter allows admins to find subnames based on the social media accounts that users have attached to their subname metadata. For example, if you want to see all subnames where users have linked their Twitter account, you can use this filter.

**Example Use Case**:

* If you're interested in engaging with users who have connected their **Twitter** account, you can filter the list to display only subnames with a Twitter handle attached. This helps in identifying which users are active on certain platforms, enabling you to run targeted campaigns or promotions based on their social activity.

**Supported Social Platforms**:

* Twitter
* GitHub
* Discord
* Telegram
* Email

### 2. Filtering by Verifications

Admins can filter users based on the verifications they have completed, such as GitHub, Twitter, or Proof of Passport (PoP). This is especially useful for assessing the trust and credibility of users who have gone through specific verification steps.

**Example Use Case**:

* If you want to view all users who have verified their **GitHub account** and also hold a **Proof of Passport**, you can apply this filter. This helps in identifying high-trust users who have completed multiple verification processes, which may be relevant to perform an airdrop free of sybil actors

**Supported Verifications**:

* Twitter Verification
* Github Verification
* Telegram Verification
* Discord Verification
* Email Verification
* Proof-of-Passport

### 3. Filtering by Claim Dates

This filter allows admins to specify a date range and see which subnames were created during that time period. Two dates are provided—**start date** and **end date**—to refine the results to subnames claimed between these two points.

**Example Use Case:**

* If you want to see all subnames that were claimed between **January 1, 2024**, and **March 31, 2024**, you can set these as the start and end dates. This allows you to monitor user growth and track how subname issuance changes over time, especially useful for understanding when your platform experienced the most activity.

### 4. Filtering by Resolution Dates

The resolution filter lets admins find subnames based on how frequently and recently they have been resolved (i.e., searched or used) across platforms. This can help you track user engagement and see which subnames are actively being used.

**Example Use Case:**

* If you want to see subnames that have been resolved (looked up) within a specific date range, you can filter by resolution dates. This provides insights into which users are actively interacting with their subnames or being searched for by others, indicating higher levels of engagement with those specific subnames.

## Applying Multiple Filters

One of the strengths of the filtering mechanism is the ability to apply multiple filters simultaneously. This allows for a more granular view of the data. For example, you could filter by:

* Subnames with a **Twitter account** attached
* That have verified their **GitHub account**
* And were claimed between **two specific dates**

This layered approach ensures that admins can zero in on very specific groups of users, enabling more targeted engagement, communication, or analysis.
