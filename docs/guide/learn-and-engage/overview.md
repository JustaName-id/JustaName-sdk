# Overview

In this section, you'll learn how to:

**View Subname Data**: Explore the different views available in the Admin Dashboard to monitor key data points such as subnames, attached addresses, claim dates, social handles, verification statuses, and resolution counts. Customize the dashboard view to show the data most relevant to your platformâ€™s needs.

{% content-ref url="views.md" %}

**Filter Subname Data**: Utilize powerful filters to refine your view based on specific criteria such as social accounts, verification statuses, claim dates, and resolution activity. These filters allow you to target specific groups of users and extract meaningful insights that help in making data-driven decisions.
